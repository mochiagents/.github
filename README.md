# Hello, Mochi

**Building open source AI agents for everyday life**

Welcome to Mochi Agents, an open source initiative dedicated to creating intelligent, practical AI agents that seamlessly integrate into daily workflows. Our mission is to democratize AI automation by providing powerful, accessible tools that anyone can use, modify, and extend.

## üåü Our Vision

We believe AI agents should be:
- **Open & Transparent**: Fully open source with clear, understandable implementations
- **Practical & Useful**: Solving real-world problems that people face every day
- **Modular & Extensible**: Built with composable components that can be mixed and matched
- **Community-Driven**: Developed collaboratively with input from users and contributors

## üå∏ About Mochi

**Mochi** is our flagship project - a sophisticated AI agent framework that transforms complex queries into actionable task execution plans. Unlike traditional chatbots, Mochi understands your intent, breaks down complex requests into manageable steps, and executes them using a rich ecosystem of tools and integrations.

### Key Capabilities
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes user queries into executable workflows
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly connects to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs multiple tasks concurrently with smart dependency management
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically adapts and repairs execution plans when things go wrong
- **Multi-Interface Support**: CLI, REST API, and programmatic interfaces for any use case

## üì¶ Mochi Components

| Component | Status | Description | Repository |

## üèó Architecture Philosophy

Mochi is built on several key principles:

### Composability
Components are designed to work together seamlessly while remaining independent and reusable.

### Extensibility
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to add new capabilities without modifying core components.

### Reliability
Built-in error handling, retry logic, and circuit breakers ensure robust operation in production environments.

### Transparency
Every decision, execution step, and tool call is logged and can be inspected for debugging and optimization.

## ü§ù Contributing
